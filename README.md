# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis can be performed on Twitter data to evaluate the overall population's attitude and opinion. Using the Tweepy API, tweets were collected and stored for one month. The dataset was cleaned using various methods to improve its quality before performing analysis. The TextBlob library was used to determine sentiment of each tweet; its polarity was then stored in a Pandas dataframe. Once the analysis was complete, various visualization tools, such as Tableau and WordCloud, were used to communicate the results.
